/// NOTE: You can use this (on a given object) or Cooldowns (static methods) as the main API for working with cooldowns.
///
/// Allows a game object to have cooldowns which can be triggered on, take a defined amount of time to
/// go off, and can be checked if they are on/off.
/// Intended to be used for a wide variety of things, such as interaction logic and abilities. A given cooldown
/// can be used across multiple components as well, such as for various melee-related actions that should not
/// be possible to spam all together.
///
/// Cooldowns are primarily defined using Cooldown assets, but for convenience there are also ways to use cooldowns
/// for one-off situations without needing to create an asset.
///
/// At the moment, there is currently NO networking logic for cooldowns. The clients (incl. host player) and server track cooldowns totally
/// separately. Generally clients only track cooldowns for their own local player for preventing interaction
/// messages being spammed to the server. We can add networking logic for future cooldown use cases if it becomes necessary.
