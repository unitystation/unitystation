/// Component which causes all of an object's children (not just sprites, so also would affect particle systems, light2d, etc...) to rotate based on its
/// current direction.
/// Use this for things like thrusters which should change their sprites / lights / effects direction based on the rotation
/// of their parent matrix. NOTE: If you need to set a pivot point for these things (as is common with light2d and
/// particle systems), you can simply create an empty child transform at the pivot point and parent the light2d / particle
/// system transforms under that. See shuttle engine prefabs for example.
