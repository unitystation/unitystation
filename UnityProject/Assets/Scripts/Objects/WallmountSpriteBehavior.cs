/// <summary>
/// Behavior for wallmount sprites.
///
/// Looks at the way a wallmount is facing by using the parent gameobject's transform.up (NOT the sprite's transform). Make sure the parent gameobject is set up so
/// the transform.up properly points in the direction the object is facing (modify the z coordinate of the rotation to adjust facing).
/// You may need to adjust the sprite rotation as well as the parent game object rotation if the object has unusual facing behavior such as
/// the Request Console.
///
/// Wallmount sprites are occluded like all the other objects, however they should only be visible on the
/// side of the wall that they are on. The occlusion logic keeps the nearest wall visible so we must
/// check which side of the wall the mount is on so we can hide it if it's on the wrong side.
/// This behavior makes the wallmount invisible if it is not facing towards the player.
/// Facing is calculated based
/// </summary>
