/// 1. Client validation logic.
/// 2. If validation succeeds, sends RequestInteractMessage to server telling it to perform the interaction.
/// 3. Server validates the requested interaction.
/// 4. If validation succeeds, server performs the interaction and informs clients as needed.

/// If you don't want to subclass this, you can instead use InteractionCoordinator in your component
