I created this font specifically with Macromedia Flash in mind.

This font is Arial set at 11px un-antialiased. I take no credit in the design of the original Arial font.

HOW TO USE:

This font uses the same rules that Miniml.com fonts use or any other Flash specific fonts that are made.

- Open flash and create a text box.

- Make sure that text box X & Y values are set to a whole number (ie: 56.0 is correct 56.1 is NOT)

- In the properties for the text box, choose Pixel Arial 11 and then set the size to 8. If you installed both fonts (regular and bold) Clicking the bold button will give the bold version of this font. 

- If you would like to use this font with HTML (specifically the <b> bold tag) you add 2 text boxes, one for regualr and one for bold, set them accordingly in the properties window. Be sure to embed the fonts. Use the un-bold arial text box to display your text. When your text has a <b> tag and the HTML option is set, your text will be BOLD and pixel crisp. Other wise it will just be a blank where text should be, so be sure to add both text boxes ANYWHERE in your project, doesn't matter where.

- Your text box should now be a crisp pixel arial font set at 11. If not, check you X & Y coordinates for the text box make sure its on a whole number.



WHY USE THIS?

Well if you play with Flash, you will know there are limitations to their program when it comes to fonts. Even with the option to pixelate the font you selected... it just never comes out exactly right, so this font is for the picky people who would like a font that is pixelated and Arial and Bold.

The font covers the basic symbols that are found on a US keyboard. 

Use this font however you feel.
