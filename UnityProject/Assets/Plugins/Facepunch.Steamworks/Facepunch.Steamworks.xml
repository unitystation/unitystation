            <summary>
            Checks if your executable was launched through Steam and relaunches it through Steam if it wasn't.
            If this returns true then it starts the Steam client if required and launches your game again through it, 
            and you should quit your process as soon as possible. This effectively runs steam://run/AppId so it may 
            not relaunch the exact executable that called it, as it will always relaunch from the version installed 
            in your Steam library folder.
            If it returns false, then your game was launched by the Steam client and no action needs to be taken.
            One exception is if a steam_appid.txt file is present then this will return false regardless. This allows
            you to develop and test without launching your game through the Steam client. Make sure to remove the 
            steam_appid.txt file when uploading the game to your Steam depot!

            Basic UDP send. Packets can't be bigger than 1200 bytes (your typical MTU size). Can be lost, or arrive out of order (rare).
            The sending API does have some knowledge of the underlying connection, so if there is no NAT-traversal accomplished or
            there is a recognized adjustment happening on the connection, the packet will be batched until the connection is open again.

            <summary>
            As above, but applies the Nagle algorithm to the send - sends will accumulate
            until the current MTU size (typically ~1200 bytes, but can change) or ~200ms has passed (Nagle algorithm).
            Useful if you want to send a set of smaller messages but have the coalesced into a single packet
            Since the reliable stream is all ordered, you can do several small message sends with k_EP2PSendReliableWithBuffering and then
            do a normal k_EP2PSendReliable to force all the buffered data to be sent.
