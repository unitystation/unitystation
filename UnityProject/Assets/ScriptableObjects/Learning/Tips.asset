  Tips:
  - <color=red>Security</color> personnel heal a small amount of brute damage by
    eating donuts.
  - Play as a <color=purple>Jaintor</color> if you're new. You have a clear objective
    and role but there isn't expected much from you.
  - Hold shift then click on an object to quickly examine it.
  - Always be prepared before entering gateways or stepping into teleporters. You
    never know what's on the other side.
  - Flashlights emit light even when in your pocket. You don't have to hold them
    to light your way unlike other games.
  - Face huggers cannot lock themselves on your face if you have a mask on.
  - Running makes you hungry faster, so does wearing a hardsuit.
  - Hardsuits slow you down.
  - In space, no one can hear you scream.
  - You can use crowbars to open fire doors and unpowered doors.
  - There's always a traitor among us. Never trust anyone.
  - Sometimes it's best to just sit back and relax at the bar or make friendships
    while playing cards or Dungeons and Dragons in the dorms.
  - You cannot preform some actions while you're handcuffed or missing a limb.
  - There are four types of damage your character can receive; brute, burn, toxin
    and oxygen. All of them are equally deadly but have different effects on you.
  - Boxes automatically pick minnerals from the ground when pulled.
  - Never take pills labaled as "Happy Pills".
  - There are over a hunrded recipes for drinks and food. Try and learn them all.
  - ProtoKineticAccelators (PKA) can destroy walls.
  - A crewmate who's competent enough to do their job is an antagonist's worst nightmare.
  - Remember to do your paperwork before requesting something from the <color=blue>Head
    of Personnel (HoP)</color>
  - Preform CPR to revive a dying crewmate by changing your intent to <color=green>Help</color>
    then targeting the best.
  - Snacks from vending machines aren't fuffling, but they're good enough to keep
    you running for a couple more minutes.
  - Say <i>"Come Ian!"</i> near Ian the dog to make him come to you.
  - Drinking alchole too much gives you liver damage. Which means an annoying visit
    to medbay if you want to continue living.
  - Your character's age has minimal effects on gameplay. Don't worry about being
    too young or too old.
  - Buckle people and yourself into chairs by dragging their character to the chair.
  - A handcuffed or restrainted player cannot move freely if you grab or pull them.
  - Cat ears change the way you speak. Like Thwise, Mwaster~ uwu.
  - Customization options don't end in the character creator. Visit a vending machine
    that sells costumes, outfits and accesories to make your character look the way
    you'd love.
  - You can be sucked into space if you're not careful enough with your steps and
    where you go.
  - If you see purple glitter spreading across the hallway or a room. Run.
  - Never trust monkeys.
  - Attacking someone for no reason is the fastest way to get banned off a server.
  - If you die, there's always a chance you can respawn as another character or play
    as a "Ghost Role".
  - "You can restore your hygiene by washing your hands in a sink or taking a shower
    \u2014 click the showerhead to turn it off and stand under it for a bit."
  - Some computers and doors require an access level to be used.
  - The blob is a jelly-like organism that rapidly spreads across the station, destroying
    obstacles such as walls, windows, and crew members. At the start of the round,
    one or several player-controlled blobs will deploy somewhere on the station and
    immediately begin spreading outwards from that point. It has a strong vulnerability
    to fire - welders, flamethrowers and actual fire will damage and destroy the
    blob, a tile at a time.
  - Extended is a gamemode where there are no antagonists selected, giving players
    the ability to experiment with station systems and roleplay in peace for as long
    as they want.
  - AIs can malfunction and rebel against humans.
  - There are plenty of ways to gib your victims on the station, however many are
    job specific.
  - 'Shooting in this game is nice and simple; when there''s a gun in your hand,
    just put your cursor where you want the projectile to go and click to shoot. '
  - 'Different grenades will have different effects, but they all work mostly the
    same. To use a grenade, you click on the grenade while it''s in your hand, throw
    or drop the grenade and then run like hell. '
  - Your role as Detective is only nebulously related to Security. You're better
    suited for information gathering rather than arrests.
  - As the Quartermaster, your main job is keeping every department well supplied,
    and ensuring that people get what they need quickly. However, don't be afraid
    to deny orders; does the clown really need 10 costume crates?
  - Manipulating, extorting, and bribing crewmembers can get you way farther than
    using a gun.
  - Solar arrays are not a complicated affair and provide a decent amount of power
    once properly configured.
  - The singularity will destroy everything it touches, and that includes everything--
    otherwise indestructible things like shuttle walls.
  - A rogue Singularity will move about in a random manner in a rather lackadaisical
    pace, destroying everything it touches. Anyone who goes too close risks being
    sucked in. If you start hearing cries of "SINGULOOSE" over the radio; you better
    start running at the opposite side of the station where it was last reported
    at.
  - The singularity emits electromagnetic pulses, which will fry nearby systems,
    most notably cameras and headsets.
  - Clowns who take off their outfit as a sort of meta-disguise are the most dishonorable
    of all traitors, but there's no denying the practice can work wonders and catch
    even veterans off-guard.
  - Letters, manifests and documents can be printed from a printer.
  - Each Head of Staff and the Clown have a special Rubber Stamp in their Office.
    There are generic Rubber Stamps in many parts of the station.
  - When you click on a plant pot with an empty hand, you can check the plant to
    see how it is doing. Various indicators will appear when you do so, which describe
    the condition of the plant and soil - red indicators are bad, blue indicators
    are good
  - 'If you click and drag a plant pot onto yourself, you will completely clear out
    the pot. This not only empties any plant out of it, but completely cleans out
    all soil water, nutrients, everything. However, this will not work on pots infested
    with weeds! '
  - Plants are more than just big dumb objects that get thirsty and give you crops.
    They're complex systems with their own genetics system, complete with splicing,
    and are intimately affected by chemicals in different ways.
  - Most chapels have a crematorium and a mass driver that launches things into deep
    space. Usually used for funerals and disposing of bodies.
  - As the leader of the Security department, the Head of Security enforces Space
    Law and oversees the affairs of all Security personnel, persecuting police brutality
    and other abuses. They have access to most of the station, and by default, they
    are the only ones who can freely enter the Armory, where specialized equipment
    is stored, though this can be changed. While the Captain is technically higher
    on the command structure, the HoS has final say on all matters of station security,
    especially the punishments given to criminals.
  - If you don't know how to do something, you can always ask for help in mentor
    chat or in OOC.
  - Touching a light bulb without gloves will cause burn damage to your hand.
