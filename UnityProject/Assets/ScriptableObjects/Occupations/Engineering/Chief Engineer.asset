  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Coordinate Engineering\n\u2022 Keep the station powered\n\u2022
    Prevent equipment theft"
  descriptionLong: "You are the Head of the Engineering Department, which includes
    not only Station Engineers, but Atmospheric Technicians as well. Your job is
    to boss around your subordinates to make sure power is running, air is breathable
    and no repairs are needed on the station.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re expected to have
    decent knowledge of how power, atmospherics, construction and repair works, but
    also know how to make your people move their butts and get to work.\r\n\r\nNot
    sure what to do? Build a new supermatter engine in the unused bathrooms. Plan
    a crazy expansion for the station, we surely need a new party room. Get yelled
    at the radio because the station is in darkness, discover that it actually was
    someone turning off the lights.\r "
