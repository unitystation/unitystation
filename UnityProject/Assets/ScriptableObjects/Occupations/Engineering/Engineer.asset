  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Do station repairs\n\u2022 Keep power flowing\n\u2022
    Fix hull breaches"
  descriptionLong: "You are the station\u2019s handyman, always ready and prepared
    to build and repair whatever that OTHER engineer broke this time. \r\n\nYour
    main responsibility is to turn on and maintain the station's power engine and
    ensure that there are no hull breaches or power failures throughout the station.\n\r\nYou
    are expected to obey the orders from the Chief Engineer and have a good understanding
    of how construction, repairing and electricity works. Don\u2019t run off with
    the hardsuit at the start of the shift!\r\n\r\nNot sure what to do? Try to make
    the Chief Engineer\u2019s crazy expansion a reality. Patrol the station so you
    can find breaches and seal them before someone gets spaced. Use your hefty toolbox
    and be the hero the station needs. Cry because assistants ran off with all of
    your metal.\r"
