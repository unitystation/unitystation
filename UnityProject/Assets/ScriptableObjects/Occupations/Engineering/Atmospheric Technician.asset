  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Keep the air breathable\n\u2022 Don't let the station
    burn down\n\u2022 Make Amtos sabotage-proof"
  descriptionLong: "Your motto is \u201CA station that can breathe is a station that
    can work.\" That doesn\u2019t rhyme but it is very important nonetheless. As
    your job title suggests, your duty is to keep the internal atmosphere in the
    station safe for everyone. You will often receive complaints on how useless you
    are, but remember, if they can complain it\u2019s because you\u2019re doing your
    job.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re expected to know and understand how gases flow, how to
    stop fires and how to make air breathable. Your job is very important and hence,
    you have a big responsibility. \r\n\r\nNot sure what to do? Try to make atmos
    an impenetrable fort. Breathe to make sure the air isn\u2019t toxic. Do not leak
    plasma into the station. Make a disposals pipe ride.\r"
