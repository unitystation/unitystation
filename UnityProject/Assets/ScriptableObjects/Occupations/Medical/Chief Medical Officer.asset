    You might or might not be the only one who actually studied medicine, but that\u2019s
    ok because it is your job to ensure doctors are doing what they are meant to
    do, save lives.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re expected to know how the chemistry and health
    system works, how to clone people in a pinch, and how to treat any of the typical
    health problems the crew may face. Keep the medbay running  like clockwork, boss
    around your subordinates, and ensure the station is a healthy place.\r\n\r\nNot
    sure what to do? Yell at the chemist to stop making lube, investigate how to
    cure the weird disease that\u2019s making evewyone tawk wike dis, get infected
    instead.\r"
