  descriptionLong: "You're the Paramedic, Respond to medical emergencies and calls
    for help. You've got just enough to keep someone alive in an emergency, and to
    heal minor wounds that would otherwise waste the time of the real doctors. \n\r\nYou\u2019re
    expected to understand the basics of how to treat wounds and stabilize patients.
    You should also be familiar with the station layout and know how to navigate
    and evacuate patients from a variety of environments. Be ready to be the person
    the rest of the station leans on in an emergency.\n\r\nNot sure what to do? You've
    got access to maintenance and to the lobbies of most departments. Use your access
    to find injured people to treat or recover. You are the go-to search-and-rescue,
    so be prepared to grab a spacesuit from EVA and drag the clown that spaced himself
    back on-board.\r"
