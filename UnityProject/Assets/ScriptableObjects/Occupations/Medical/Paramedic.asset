  descriptionLong: "You're the Paramedic, treat people that you can and bring those
    that you can't to medbay for the doctors to handle. You've got just enough to
    keep someone alive in an emergency, and to heal minor wounds that would otherwise
    waste the time of the real doctors. You're also the go-to search-and-rescue,
    grab a spacesuit from EVA and drag the clown that spaced himself back on-board.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re
    expected to understand the basics of the health system, healing, and the use
    of medical supplies.\r\n\r\nNot sure what to do? You've got access to maintenance
    and to the lobbies of most departments. Use your access to find injured people
    to treat or recover."
