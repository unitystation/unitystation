    lives. Know your medical tools and consumables, and treat health conditions accordingly.\r\n\r\nNot
    sure what to do? keep your workplace clean. Keep an eye on the medbay desk to
    see if someone is in need of medical attention, get mad when people trespass
    into medbay and try to heal themselves.\r"
