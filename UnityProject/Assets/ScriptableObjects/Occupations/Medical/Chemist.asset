  descriptionLong: "You\u2019re the Chemist and it\u2019s time to cook. You have
    all the implements and knowledge to break in anywhere you desire or kill anyone
    in the most inhuman ways or even make half the station addicts to something,
    but  yet you don\u2019t, because this is not about harming people, this is about
    the power of chemistry.\r\n\r\nAs the chemist you\u2019re expected to know and
    understand how the chemistry system works, how substances react to each other
    and how to supply medicines to the rest of the Medical team.\r\n\r\nNot sure
    what to do? Make medicines for the stationeers. Experiment, learn all the different
    interactions between substances. Do not make lube grenades or transform your
    workplace into a drug lab. \r"
