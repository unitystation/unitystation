  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Order equipment for the station\n\u2022 Coordinate shaft
    miners\n\u2022 Flood the station with paperwork"
  descriptionLong: "You are in charge of the station economy. Your duty is to buy
    and sell cargo and to try and make a profit. Keep track of what goes in and out
    and make the crew fill out paperwork for their orders. Supply them with the equipment
    they need to keep working and delay the station's descent into chaos.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re
    expected to know and understand how the cargo console works and to keep an eye
    on the credits. Crewmembers will come to your desk and ask for supplies. It is
    your job to make sure everyone gets what they need whenever you don\u2019t suspect
    it is for devilish deeds.\r It is your responsibility to fulfill the shipment
    quota requested by Centcom.\n\r\nNot sure what to do? Try to keep people out
    of your department; for some reason everyone loves to get in and disturb your
    labor. Design an incredibly detailed form and make the crew fill it. Manage your
    cargo technicians and miners to be the most (only?) efficient department on the
    station. Yell at miners over the radio to get back with rocks already!"
