  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Mine ores\n\u2022 Process them into useful materials\n\u2022
    Kill hostile wildlife"
  descriptionLong: "You are a miner. You are the only one in the station who does
    actual hard work, but you don\u2019t mind because you are free. You get to leave
    the commodities of modernity and explore the universe. You see things people
    wouldn\u2019t believe exist. You bring back minerals to the station after risking
    your life fighting alien wildlife...Yet you want to go out there again, because
    you are a miner.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re expected to obey the orders from the Quartermaster
    and bring resources to the station so they can be sold, processed or researched.
    Understanding how the hardsuit, internals and piloting works can come in very
    handy.\r\n\r\nNot sure what to do? Coordinate with your fellow miners to go to
    an asteroid and bring the minerals home. Do not revolt and raise against all
    authority with the Cargo Technicians. Fight aliens and bring them home too. Ignore
    all cries of help and chaos from the station and play your own roguelike.\r"
