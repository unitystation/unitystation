  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Mine ores\n\u2022 Process them into useful materials\n\u2022
    Kill hostile wildlife"
  descriptionLong: "You are a miner. You are the only one in the station who does
    actual hard work, but you don\u2019t mind because inside your heart, you are
    free. You get to leave the conveniences of modernity and explore the wild universe
    outside the station. You see things people wouldn\u2019t believe exist. You bring
    back minerals to the station after risking your life fighting alien monsters...Yet
    you want to go out there again, because you are a miner.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re expected
    to obey the orders from the Quartermaster and bring resources to the station
    so they can be sold, processed or researched. Understanding how the hardsuit,
    internals and piloting works can come in very handy.\r\n\r\nNot sure what to
    do? Coordinate with your fellow miners to go to an asteroid and bring the minerals
    home.  Fight aliens and bring their corpses home with you for the chef to prepare.
    Ignore all cries of help and chaos from the station and play your own roguelike.\r"
