  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Assist the crew.\n\u2022 Learn Unitystation, use OOC
    for help.\n\u2022 Ask the HOP for a job."
  descriptionLong: "You are an assistant, a new face on the station here to shadow
    and assist many of the department members in their day-to-day operations. You
    are here to help, or inevitably not help, the crew where you can.\r\n\r\nThe
    assistant role is perfect for new players, as it\u2019s understood that in all
    aspects of the game not much is to be expected of you. It\u2019s great for learning
    the nuances of the game, the controls, mechanics, and different roles throughout
    the station. If you need further guidance, remember that OOC chat is the perfect
    place to ask others for help.\r\n\r\nIf you get lost, or don\u2019t know what
    to do, explore the station and the different departments, someone will need your
    help and will be glad to teach you a thing or two.\r"
