  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Mop the floors\n\u2022 Collect trash\n\u2022 Use wet
    floor signs"
  descriptionLong: "You have a huge responsibility. If the station looks like a zoo,
    you can take for granted that the crew will behave like animals. You\u2019re
    single handedly the frontier between a sane station and full anarchy.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re
    expected to keep the floors clean and mop all the blood, vomit and other fluids.
    Pick up the trash, change faulty light bulbs and put wet floor signs that no
    one pays attention to. Believe me, it is more fun than it sounds.\r\n\r\nNot
    sure what to do? Point at your wet floor sign when someone inevitably slips.
    Answer all the cleaning emergencies on the radio. Find illegal activity in maintenance.\r"
