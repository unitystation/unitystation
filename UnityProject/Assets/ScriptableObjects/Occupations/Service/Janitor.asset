  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Mop the floors\n\u2022 Collect trash\n\u2022 Use wet
    floor signs"
  descriptionLong: "You have an inocuously small, yet, huge responsibility; keep
    the station free of filth and grime. If the station looks like a zoo, you can
    take for granted that the crew will behave like animals. You\u2019re single handedly
    the frontier between a sane station and full anarchy.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re expected
    to keep the floors clean and mop all the blood, vomit and other fluids. Pick
    up the trash, change faulty light bulbs and put down wet floor signs that no
    one pays attention to. Believe me, it is more fun than it sounds.\r\n\r\nNot
    sure what to do? Point at your wet floor sign when someone inevitably slips.
    Answer all the cleaning emergencies on the radio. Learn the layout of the various
    departments as you are invited in to clean them. Find illegal activity in maintenance.\r
    <b>This is the premiere role for new players.</b>"
