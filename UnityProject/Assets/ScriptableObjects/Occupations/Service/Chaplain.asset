  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Preach\n\u2022 Hold services and funerals\n\u2022 Make
    up a religion"
  descriptionLong: "Serve your god, or gods, in a manner that benefits the crew (up
    for interpretation). Your responsibilities, like your station access, are limited.
    Invoking spirituality amongst the crew is your main priority - so not much besides
    begging people to attend services and nobody showing up. \n\nBeing a roleplay
    heavy role, it\u2019s encouraged that you interact with the crew to create events
    or to enforce religious sanctions and rulesets. Perform small miracles with your
    null rod and holy book as needed. Religion is sparse in this corner of space,
    so don\u2019t expect everyone to get in line outside your office unprompted.\r
    Most rounds you\u2019ll end up holding funerals for those that the station cares
    deeply about (and cremating everyone else).\r\n\r\nNot sure what to do? Declare
    the day a religious holiday and host festive events, host seminars to educate
    the masses, or give the clown your holy blessing!"
