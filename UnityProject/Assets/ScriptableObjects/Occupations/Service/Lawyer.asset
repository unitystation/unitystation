  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Advocate for prisoners\n\u2022 Create contracts\n\u2022
    Sue lawbreakers"
  descriptionLong: "Did you know that you have rights? Well you should because you\u2019re
    the lawyer and it is your duty to protect every woman, man and children\u2019s
    rights in this station. Your friend Larry is being accused of killing his ex-girlfriend
    with a clock? Get him out of trouble using nothing but your rhetoric. A prisoner\u2019s
    right to get medical attention is being neglected? Sue the warden, sue the HoS,
    sue the entire Security department, why stop there? Sue Nanotrasen!\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re
    expected to be comfortable with roleplaying as this is indeed a heavy-roleplay
    role. You will need to study the Space Law and ensure that security is complying
    with it, or just make up stuff\u2026  I don\u2019t expect security to actually
    know the law.\r\n\r\nNot sure what to do? Talk to the prisoners and make sure
    they have a fair sentence, get them food and medical attention, find safety hazards
    in the Engineering department and sue Nanotrasen, participate in trials and try
    to get your client out of jail.\r"
