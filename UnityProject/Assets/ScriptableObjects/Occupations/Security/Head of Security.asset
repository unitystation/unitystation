    Fight corruption"
  descriptionLong: "You like challenges, don\u2019t you? Because being the Head of
    the entire security department, tasked with protecting the entire station and
    its crew isn\u2019t an easy job. You lead your modest crew of officers and the
    rest of the brig personnel to victory against those who wish harm against Nanotrasen.
    Just try to avoid becoming a monster when fighting monsters.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re
    expected to be a leader and coordinate all the security operators on the station.
    You must know the correct procedure and make sure everything your subordinates
    do is complying with the Space Law. Like all Security personnel, you\u2019re
    expected to be \u201Crobust\u201D (know the combat mechanics).\r\n\r\nNot sure
    what to do? Try to keep your team alive by working together and communicating
    with your officers effectively. Update Command with security reports.\r"
