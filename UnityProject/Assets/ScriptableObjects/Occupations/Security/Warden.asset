  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Guard the brig\n\u2022 Release prisoners when it's time\n\u2022
    Help the other security staff"
  descriptionLong: "You\u2019re the second in Security's chain of command, right-hand
    to the Head of Security. You ensure criminals are treated as fairly as they deserve
    under Space Law. Keep Security geared up and keep the power-thirsty... well,
    thirsty!\r\n\r\nYour main responsibilities are the brig, the precious armory,
    and the prisoners under your watchful eye.. Keep track of gear distribution..
    Process new prisoners and release them once they complete their sentence. If
    something happens to the Head of Security, it's your duty to take over, so get
    to know your team. Like all Security personnel, you\u2019re expected to be \u201Crobust\u201D
    (know the combat mechanics).\r\n\r\nNot sure what to do? Create a system for
    weapon checkout to foil the inevitable attempt at a hostile takeover. Log which
    torture interrogation methods yield best results. Set timers for prison sentences,
    but check on them to avoid prison breaks or the dreaded piles of paperwork for
    letting an inmate die from your negligence."
