    procedure\n\u2022 Eat donuts"
  descriptionLong: "Welcome to the force, kid. Not only is the station and its crew
    a continual threat to themselves, we have the constant menace of unknown, external
    enemies. We\u2019re not here to be loved or make friends, we\u2019re here because
    we\u2019re tough enough to deal with all the scum that roams the facility and
    the space beyond. Our duty is to make the place safe enough to keep producing
    for Nanotrasen and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do regardless of the
    cost.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re expected to know the proper procedure to minimize damage
    and neutralize threats under compliance with the Space Law. Like all Security
    personnel, you\u2019re expected to be \u201Crobust\u201D (know the combat mechanics).\r\n\r\nNot
    sure what to do? Patrol the station, man the strategic outposts, attend the security
    desk to receive and register reports. Investigate said reports and emit arrest
    warrants when needed. Instruct assistants to \u201Cpick up that can.\u201D\r"
