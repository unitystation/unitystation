  descriptionLong: "You\u2019re heading to that putrid bar. You\u2019re interrupted
    in your way, your detective instinct yells at you that someone has been following
    you the entire time. You turn around just to find a glance of a shadow running
    away after leaving a piece of paper under your feet. In the paper, an inscription
    made with bright green crayon, \u201CHonk\u201D it says, but what does it mean?
    This mystery will hunt you for the rest of the shift.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re expected
    to investigate crimes, gather evidence and solve mysteries. The detective is
    practical like the security officer but with a lot of roleplaying sprinkled on
    top. Like all Security personnel, you\u2019re expected to be \u201Crobust\u201D
    (know the combat mechanics).\r\n\r\nNot sure what to do? Go to the bar and interview
    people, make a list of suspects, accuse the Butler! Make obnoxious monologues
    in the hall for everyone to hear. Try to wipe \u201Cthat expression\u201D off
    your face while recovering from your bar crawl.\r"
