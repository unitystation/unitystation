  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Protect VIPs\n\u2022 Secure High Risk Items"
  descriptionLong: 'Welcome, Redshield. You have been given special training by Central
    Command, and been dispatched to serve as the personal bodyguard of everyone with
    access to Command Comms.



    Most of your time will be spent shadowing those
    you have been assigned to protect, making sure that they''re alive and well,
    and keep an eye on a crew monitor to make sure they''re still on sensors. Your
    job is to keep everyone in Command, as well as CentCom VIPs, alive.



    One
    very important detail of your job is that you are not Security. Do not let your
    Security (and Detective) access fool you. Your ID lets you reach every single
    Command Office on the station. You should not be concerned with the goings-on
    at Security, nor should you be doing their job for them. You are not a Security
    Officer with elevated access and snazzy outfit. You are a bodyguard.'
