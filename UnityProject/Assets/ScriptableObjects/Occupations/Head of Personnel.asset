  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Alter ID card access\n\u2022 Manage civil departmants\n\u2022
    Protect Ian"
  descriptionLong: "You are the third in command (second is Ian). Your duty is to
    manage all the personnel access to different areas, to make sure the Quartermaster
    is actually producing and supplying the station, and to take command in case
    Captain is indisposed.\r\n\r\nPeople will expect you to be at your office and
    attend the HoP line so you can deny access to all areas to mischievous crew members.
    You need to know how to use the Identification Console and manage ID permissions.
    \r\n\r\nNot sure what to do? Start by opening the shutters so people can line
    up for their requests, make sure all the assistants have a job, and take Ian
    for a walk.\r\n"
