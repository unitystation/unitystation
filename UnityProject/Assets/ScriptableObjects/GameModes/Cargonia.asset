  description: A band of workers, who after an argument with Human Resources over
    labor rights and subsequent firing, have covertly secured positions in a department
    aboard this station. Their time for action is now, and they plan to secede and
    form an independant department. They have no intention of being stopped, and
    this time they're the ones doing the firing.
