  description: A space wizard has been tasked to assault the station! Wielding an
    arsenal of powerful spells that can defy physics and even time and space itself,
    they will stop at nothing to advance the Space Wizard Federation's agenda (which
    is suspiciously similar to the Syndicate's). Nanotrasen and the SWF are known
    enemies, so the crew has no choice but to destroy the wizard! Accomplish this
    by beating the wizard's brains in with anything on hand.
