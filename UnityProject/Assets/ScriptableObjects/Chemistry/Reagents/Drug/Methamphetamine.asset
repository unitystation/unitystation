  description: Reduces stun times by about 300%, speeds the user up, and allows the
    user to quickly recover stamina while dealing a small amount of Brain damage.
    If overdosed the subject will move randomly, laugh randomly, drop items and suffer
    from Toxin and Brain damage. If addicted the subject will constantly jitter and
    drool, before becoming dizzy and losing motor control and eventually suffer heavy
    toxin damage.
