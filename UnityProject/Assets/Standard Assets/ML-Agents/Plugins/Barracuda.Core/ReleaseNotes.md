# Release notes

## 0.2.4
- Switched to 2018.4.3f1 as primary Unity version for testing.
- Fixed ScaleBias scheduling issue with large amounts of data (reproduced with MobileNet @ 16 batch)
- Fixed buffer overrun in ThreadGroup SharedMemory when TRANSPOSE_X and/or SHIFTED_X paths are enabled. This should fix GPU worker issues on Windows.
- Added string cache to minimise string concat generated GC pressure.
- Added small fixes for temp memory allocations, saves ~200B per layer.
- Refactored inner loop workings, to avoid GC allocations for delegates.
- Fixed input handling for layers, now inputs are not regenerated with every execution. Static model tensors are to stay forever until worker is disposed.
- Bumped Burst version to 1.1.1.

## 0.2.3
- Rewritten Dense, Conv and some other ops on GPU. Speedup of 33% in most models with batch=1 and over 100% for batch=16.
- Optimizations: reimplemented InstanceNormalization using pyramid approach for calculating mean and variance.

## 0.2.2
- Added support for --print-supported-ops flag for model converters, now it will print approximate list of supported operations. List of supported ops depends on converter.
- Added Keras converter as part of distribution.
- Now compute shaders are loaded only if GPU worker is requested.
- Fixed bug in MaxPool and AvgPool padding. Issue discovered by Yolo faces network.
- Fixed bug in Transpose convolution support for C# backend.
- Fixed TF model conversion with two LSTM cells.
- Fixed case when strided slice end overflows to zero and thus producing negative range.

## 0.2.1
- TF importer: fixed ResizeNearestNeighbor aka Upsample2D scaling factor detection.
- TF importer: optimized node sorting. Should be faster than 0.2.0.
- TF importer: made detection of actual output node from LSTM/GRU pattern more bullet proof by skipping Const nodes.
- TF importer: improved InstanceNormalization handling.
- TF importer: fixed SquareDifference pattern.
- TF importer: fixed Conv2DBackpropInput (transpose convolution) import. 
- Fixed Conv2D performance regression on some GPUs.
- Fixed TextureAsTensorData.Download() to work properly with InterpretDepthAs.Channels.
- Fixed bug when identity/nop layers would reuse input as an output and later causing premature release of that tensor as part of intermediate data cleanup.
- Added scale + bias to TenstorToRenderTexture interface, usefull for adjusting network output scale + bias on the fly.
- Fixed double Dispose issue when worker gets garbage collected.

## 0.2.0
- Version bumped to 0.2.0 as it brings breaking API changes, for details look below. 
- Significantly reduced temporary memory allocations by introducing internal allocator support. Now memory is re-used between layer execution as much as possible.
- Improved small workload performance on CSharp backend
- Added parallel implementation for multiple activation functions on CSharp backend
- Added `Peek()` function to `IWorker`, it retains object storage in worker's allocator, useful for quick grabbing of output. If you want to preserve content of output tensor between `Execute()` invocations, then use `Fetch()`.
- Fixed ESRGAN model conversion (ONNX importer).
- Fixed Tensor <-> Texture copy for textures/tensors that dimensions are not multiple of 8.
- Added `Summary()` method to `Worker`. Currently returns allocator information.
- Tabs to spaces! Aiming at higher salary (https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/).
- Renamed worker type enum members: `CSharp` -> `CSharpRef`, `CSharpFast` -> `CSharp`, `Compute` -> `ComputeRef`, `ComputeFast` -> `Compute`.
- Implemented new optimized `ComputePrecompiled` worker. This worker caches Compute kernels and state beforehand to reduce CPU overhead. 
- Added `ExecuteAsync()` to `IWorker` interface, it returns `IEnumerator`, which enables you to control how many layers to schedule per frame (one iteration == one layer).
- Added `Log` op support on Compute workers.
- Optimized activation functions and ScaleBias by accessing tensor as continuous array. Gained ~2.0ms on 4 batch MobileNet (MBP2016).
- Introduced _Loop version of activations to fight 65535 scheduling limit on D3D11.
- Added .nn as Barracuda model file extension for use in Unity Editor. Also added simple editor importer. Now you can declare serializable fields as NNModel to bind them to .nn asset. ModelLoader.Load() now accepts NNModel as a source.
- Compute: Reduce reference GPU implementation.
- TF importer: Expanded Mean support to mean over channels, implemented Pad (as Border2D), implemented SquaredDifference, added InstanceNormalization and LeakyRelu patterns, StridedSlice implementation.
- TF importer: sort model nodes by dependencies before processing.
- Fixed ComputeBuffer leak when using Compute and ComputePrecompiled backends.
- Made to use Conv2D_L1Cached64_RegisterBlock4x4 more often: improves perf ~2x on Vega 16, and ~30% on Nvidia and Intel.

## 0.1.6
- Added activation type print in verbose mode
- Added fast and parallel CPU implementation for Swish, Relu, Add, Sub, Div, Min, Max, Tanh, Exp
- Removed duplicate profiler blocks for ops

- Fixed compatibility with Unity 2019.2.x

## 0.1.5
- Added Transpose, MatMul and Indentity layer support for models exported from ONNX.
- Added BasicLSTM layer support for models exported from TF. Limited set of LSTM networks should work now.
- Added DepthwiseConv2D layer support. Most of the networks based on the MobileNet should work now.

- Improved memory handling, now less GC allocations should be made per inference execution.

## 0.1.3
- Improved Barracuda support for Unity Profiler.
- Cleaned up Barracuda APIs.
- Added direct ``Texture`` input support. Look for ``TextureAsTensorData``. The following types of texture supported as input: ``Texture2D``, ``Texture2DArray``, ``Texture3D``, ``RenderTexture``.
- Added ``Tensor`` to ``RenderTexture`` conversion. Look for ``TensorToRenderTexture``.
- Autoencoder type networks can run completely on GPU now. Data roundtrip via CPU is not necessary anymore.
- Vertical flip is applied when converting between ``Texture`` and ``Tensor`` to match conventionts. To override this behavior look for ``TextureAsTensorData.Flip`` enum.
- Removed direct reference to WebCamTexture, now Barracuda compiles for Console targets.
- Fixed _Conv2DTranspose_ layer support. Now GANs using _Conv2DTranspose_ work properly.
- Added automated test for pix2pix GAN.

## 0.1.2
- Barracuda now is also available as preview package. Look for ``com.unity.barracuda`` in https://staging-packages.unity.com registry.

- Added profiler sample for ``Fetch()``.
- Fixed compilation issues on Xbox One.
- TexConv2D support was temporary disabled.
- Barracuda logging now can be configured via static fields of ``Barracuda.D`` class, it allows both disable specific logging levels or just disable stack trace collection (helps with performance when profiling).

- Fixed several ``ComputeBuffer`` release issues.
