  theThoughtsOfSomeoneAboutToRunOverSomeGreenGlowies:
  - Something moved past the corner of my eye..
  - What if a meteor hits the station and i die?
  - Did I leave a stove off before coming here?
  - Did I hear something whispering my name?
  - I feel like I'm being watched..
  - I can't trust anyone..
  - They're after me, I know it
  - I thought I saw someone in a red space suit behind me..
  - Oh god, I'm going to die!
  - I feel like someone is staring at me..
  - Why am I even here? I feel like someone or something is working against me..
  - Need to protect my stuff.. They're out to steal from me!
  - The colors, what do they mean?
  - The colors, it's a secret message by people plotting against me!
  - Everyone.. Harmful..
  - Let me out of here!
  - I don't want to die!
  - Everyone better stay away from me! I'm not afraid to use anything to protect
    myself!
