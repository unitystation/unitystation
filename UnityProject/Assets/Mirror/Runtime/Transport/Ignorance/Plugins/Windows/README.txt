This is a Windows x64 build of ENet-CSharp.

If you require a version of ENet for 32 Bit computer systems (ie. Windows 7/8/10 32Bit) then please get in touch, or you can install the requirements yourself and compile it using ENet-CSharp's MSBuild-based build system. Get in touch if you want me to compile them for you, but keep in mind that I do not support them when reporting bugs.
