Using ENET on Windows x86 (aka 32bit Windows) is not *exactly* supported since I am focusing on supporting 64bit Windows Instances.

I am providing a compiled 32bit DLL as a goodwill gesture; if you encounter bugs with ENET on 32bit Windows, you MUST test if the bug happens on 64bit Windows before filing a bug report.

You should really encourage your player base to upgrade to 64bit operating systems at least. Seriously, it's the way of the future and you will be left behind if you don't.
