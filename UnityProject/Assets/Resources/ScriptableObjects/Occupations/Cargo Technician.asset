  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Order things for people\n\u2022 Load and unload crates\n\u2022
    Deliver the orders"
  descriptionLong: "You are the delivery boy. It is a thankless job, but in the end
    you know you are the difference between productivity and chaos. Part of your duty
    is to manage the Cargo computer and make orders for the people who come to your
    desk. You load and unload crates from the cargo shuttle and deliver the goods
    to those in need.\r\n\r\nAs the Cargo Technician you\u2019re expected to obey
    the orders from the Quartermaster and accomplish his desire to be millionaire.
    Communicate with your coworkers to keep the department working like a well oiled
    machine. Deliver the orders to the crew.\r\n\r\nNot sure what to do? Sit on your
    chair and make sure to receive orders from the station. Communicate by radio when
    an order is ready and make them pick it up instead of delivering to their department.
    Do not start a revolution and make the independent state of Cargonia. \r"
