    patrons"
  descriptionLong: "You are the barkeep on this station. Your job is to keep drinks
    flowing, maintain your bar, and have an open ear to whoever stumbles in, be it
    Assistant or Captain.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re expected to serve your patrons and to
    relay food orders to the Cook. You should know a couple drink recipes, the fancier
    the better. This job requires some skill in the RP department, so you can keep
    your patrons entertained.\r\n\r\nNot sure what to do? Experiment! There may be
    a few special cocktails for you to discover. Mix drinks, juices, chemicals, and
    gases together... What's the worst that could happen? The bar can be a lively
    place, it\u2019s up to you if you want to encourage chaos or run a clean joint.\r"
