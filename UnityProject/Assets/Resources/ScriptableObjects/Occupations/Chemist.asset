  descriptionLong: "You\u2019re the Chemist and it\u2019s time to cook. You have all
    the implements and knowledge to break in anywhere you desire or kill anyone in
    the most inhuman ways or even make half the station addicts to something, but
    \ yet you don\u2019t, because this is not about harming people, this is about
    the power of chemistry.\r\n\r\nAs the chemist you\u2019re expected to know and
    understand how the chemistry system works, how substances react to each other
    and how to supply medicines to the medbay.\r\n\r\nNot sure what to do? Make medicines
    for the stationeers. Experiment, learn all the different interactions between
    substances. Do not make lube grenades or transform your workplace into a drug
    lab. \r"
