  descriptionLong: "You are the Atmospheric technician, and your motto is \u201CBreathing
    is mandatory\u201D! As your job title suggests, your duty is to keep the internal
    atmosphere on the station pristine and breathable. You might receive complaints
    about your uselessness, but remember, if they can complain it\u2019s because you\u2019re
    doing your job.\r\n\r\nAs an Atmospheric Technician you\u2019re expected to know
    and understand how gases flow, how to stop fires and how to make air breathable.
    Your job is very important and hence, you have a big responsibility. \r\n\r\nNot
    sure what to do? Try to make your department an impenetrable fort. Breathe to
    make sure they air isn\u2019t toxic. Prevent plasma leaks.\r"
