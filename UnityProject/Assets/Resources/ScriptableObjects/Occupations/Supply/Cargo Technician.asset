  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Order things for people\n\u2022 Load and unload crates\n\u2022
    Deliver the orders"
  descriptionLong: "You are the delivery boy. It is a thankless job, but in the end
    you know you are the difference between productivity and chaos. Part of your
    duty is to manage the Cargo computer and make orders for the people who come
    to your desk. You load and unload crates from the cargo shuttle and deliver the
    goods to those in need.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re expected to obey the orders from the
    Quartermaster and accomplish his desire to be a millionaire. Communicate with
    your coworkers to keep the department working like a well oiled machine. Deliver
    the orders to the crew.\r\n\r\nNot sure what to do? Sit in your chair and receive
    orders from the station. Communicate by radio when an order is ready and make
    them pick it up instead of delivering to their department. Do not start a revolution
    and make the independent state of Cargonia. Keep security from putting their
    noses into your business.\r"
