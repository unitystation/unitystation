  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Mop the floors\n\u2022 Collect trash\n\u2022 Use wet floor
    signs"
  descriptionLong: "You are the Janitor and you have a huge responsibility. If the
    station looks like a zoo, you can take for granted that the crew will behave like
    animals. You\u2019re single handedly the frontier between a sane station and full
    anarchy.\r\n\r\nAs the janitor people will expect from you to keep the floors
    clean and mop all the blood, vomit and other fluids. Pick up the trash, change
    faulty light bulbs and put wet floor signs that no one pays attention to.\r\n\r\nNot
    sure what to do? Point at your wet floor sign when someone inevitably slips. Answer
    all the cleaning emergencies on the radio. Find illegal activity in maintenance.\r"
