  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Manage the station\n\u2022 Manage your staff\n\u2022
    Keep the crew alive"
  descriptionLong: 'You are the top of the Chain of Command. It is your duty to ensure
    the stability and productivity of the station, as well as carrying out orders
    issued to you by Centcom.



    People expect you to be a leader and command
    your crew to keep everyone alive, and more importantly, working. Make sure everyone
    has a job to do and is collaborating to achieve the station objective. Pay attention
    to possible threats and always be prepared to call the escape shuttle in case
    things get too chaotic. A good grasp of station mechanics and Standard Operating
    Procedure is required,  so only experienced players should play this role.



    Not
    sure what to do? Make announcements to keep the crew morale high, declare stuff
    as illegal and see how security does nothing to support your order, chair meetings
    with the other Department Heads, call the escape shuttle when there is no way
    the station can keep producing, recall it when the clown is finally spaced.
