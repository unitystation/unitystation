  displayName: Chief Engineer
  difficulty: 3
  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Coordinate Engineering\n\u2022 Keep the station powered\n\u2022
    Prevent equipment theft"
  descriptionLong: "You are the Head of the Engineering Department, which includes
    not only Station Engineers, but Atmospheric Technicians as well. Essentially your
    job is to boss around your subordinates to make sure power is running, air is
    breathable and no repairs are needed on the station.\r\n\r\nAs the Chief Engineer
    you\u2019re expected to have a decent knowledge of how power, atmospherics, construction
    and repair works, but also know how to make your people move their butts and get
    to work.\r\n\r\nNot sure what to do?\r\nKeep track of what your engineers are
    doing, stop them from setting fires, fight power outages only to discover that
    the light switch was off.\r\n"
