  descriptionLong: "You're the Medical Doctor, ...Well maybe \u201CDoctor\u201D is
    inaccurate, but you do treat people\u2019s wounds and diseases. Nanotrasen has
    equipped you with cutting edge technology to assist you in your labor of keeping
    people alive. Remember, dead people can\u2019t work, but they can be cloned.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re
    expected to understand the basics of the health system. Know your medical supplies
    and machines and treat all health problems accordingly.\r\n\r\nNot sure what
    to do? Clean all the blood in your workplace, keep an eye on the medbay desk
    to see if someone is in need of medical attention, get mad when people trespass
    into medbay and try to heal themselves.\r"
