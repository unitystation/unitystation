  descriptionLong: "You're the Medical Doctor, ...Well maybe \u201CDoctor\u201D is
    inaccurate, but you do treat people\u2019s wounds and diseases. Nanotrasen has
    equipped you with cutting edge technology to assist you in your labor of keeping
    people alive. Remember, dead people can\u2019t work.\r\n\r\nAs the Medical Doctor
    you\u2019re expected to understand the basics of the health system. Treat people\u2019s
    wounds and diseases, and even bring them back from the dead with the clone machine.\r\n\r\nNot
    sure what to do? Clean all the blood in your workplace, keep an eye on the medbay
    desk to see if someone is in need of medical attention, get mad when people trespass
    medbay and try to heal themselves.\r\n"
