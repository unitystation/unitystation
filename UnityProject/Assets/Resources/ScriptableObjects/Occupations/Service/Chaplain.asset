  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Preach\n\u2022 Hold services and funerals\n\u2022 Make
    up a religion"
  descriptionLong: "Serve your god, or gods, in a manner that benefits the crew (up
    for interpretation). Most rounds you\u2019ll end up holding funerals for those
    that the station cares deeply about (and cremating everyone else). You come equipped
    with your holy text, and when it comes to prayers; the deities you pray to are
    far more likely to hear, and answer, your prayers. \r\n\r\nYour responsibilities,
    like your station access, are limited. Invoking spirituality amongst the crew
    is your main priority - so not much besides begging people to attend services
    and nobody showing up. Being a roleplay heavy role, it\u2019s encouraged that
    you interact with the crew to create events or to enforce religious sanctions
    and rulesets. Religion is sparse in this corner of space, so don\u2019t expect
    everyone to get in line outside your office unprompted.\r\n\r\nNot sure what
    to do? Declare the day a religious holiday and host festive events, host seminars
    to educate the masses, or give the clown your holy blessing!"
