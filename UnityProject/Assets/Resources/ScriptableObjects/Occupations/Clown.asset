    Tell (bad) jokes and puns"
  descriptionLong: "You are the Clown, and you\u2019re funny! At least that\u2019s
    what you tell yourself. Making bad puns <b>is</b> the greatest source of entertainment,
    right?\r\n\r\nYou have no official responsibility, except to make station life
    more interesting. Perform harmless pranks, make bad jokes and HONK to your heart\u2019s
    content. The crew will usually tolerate your shenanigans - until you make the
    captain slip on a banana peel one too many times. Then you\u2019ll find yourself
    on the title screen.\r\n\r\nNot sure what to do? Try to stay alive, organize
    a comedy show, and HONK HONK HONK.\r"
