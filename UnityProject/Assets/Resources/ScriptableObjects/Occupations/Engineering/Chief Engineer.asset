  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Coordinate Engineering\n\u2022 Keep the station powered\n\u2022
    Prevent equipment theft"
  descriptionLong: "You are the Head of the Engineering Department, which includes
    not only Station Engineers, but Atmospheric Technicians as well. Your job is
    to boss around your subordinates to make sure power is running, air is breathable
    and no repairs are needed on the station.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re expected to have
    decent knowledge of how power, atmospherics, construction and repair works, but
    also know how to make your people move their butts and get to work.\r\n\r\nNot
    sure what to do? Plan a crazy expansion for the station, we surely need a new
    party room. Get yelled at the radio because the station is in darkness, discover
    that it actually was someone turning off the lights.\r"
