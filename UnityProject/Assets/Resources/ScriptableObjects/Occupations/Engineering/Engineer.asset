  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Do station repairs\n\u2022 Keep power flowing\n\u2022
    Fix hull breaches"
  descriptionLong: "You are the station\u2019s handyman, always ready and prepared
    to build and repair whatever that OTHER engineer broke this time. \r\n\r\nYou
    are expected to obey the orders from the Chief Engineer and have a good understanding
    of how construction, repairing and power works. Don\u2019t run off with the hardsuit
    at the start of the shift!\r\n\r\nNot sure what to do? Try to make the Chief
    Engineer\u2019s crazy expansion a reality. Patrol the station so you can find
    breaches and seal them before someone gets spaced. Use your hefty toolbox and
    be the hero the station needs. Cry because assistants ran off with all of your
    metal.\r"
