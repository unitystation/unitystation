  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Assist the crew.\n\u2022 Learn Unitystation, use OOC for
    help.\n\u2022 Ask the HOP for a job."
  descriptionLong: 'The perfect job for new players. Assistants aren''t specialized,
    and the crew won''t expect much of you.


    Feel free to get to know the station at your leisure. Remember to use the OOC
    chat channel if you have any questions about how to play.


    Not sure what to do? Offer your help on the radio, or ask the Head of Personnel
    for a job.


    Experienced players might fly under the radar by being an Assistant. Which they
    can use to their advantage...'
