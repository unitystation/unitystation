  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Grow fresh produce\n\u2022 Tend to your garden\n\u2022
    Experiment!"
  descriptionLong: "You are the chilliest dude on board, like seriously, you\u2019re
    the kind of guy who enjoys watching the grass grow. Your principal labor is to
    supply the kitchen with fresh produce to keep the station fed but there is always
    time to grow other stuff for recreational purposes.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re expected
    to know at least the basics of hydroponics and supply the kitchen with fresh
    produce. The rest of the time, you can do whatever you can.\r\n\r\nNot sure what
    to do? Experiment! Try to improve the produce combining characteristics of different
    vegetables. Grow exotic plants that may or may not eat humans. Make manufactured
    products from hemp.\r"
