  descriptionLong: "You are the Head of Personnel, third in command (second is your
    dog Ian). Your duty is to manage all the personnel access to different areas,
    to make sure the Quartermaster is actually producing and supplying the station,
    and to take command in case Captain is indisposed.\r\n\r\nAs the HoP people will
    expect you to be at your office and attend the HoP line. Hence, you need to know
    how to use the HoP computer and manage ID permissions.\r\n\r\nNot sure what to
    do? Start by opening the shutters so people can line up for their requests, make
    sure all the assistants have a job, take Ian for a walk.\r"
