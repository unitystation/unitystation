  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Preach\n\u2022 Hold services and funerals\n\u2022 Make
    up a religion"
  descriptionLong: "There's something about the vast infinity of space that turns
    men to prayer. Especially if they get thrown into it without a space suit - which
    is why we hired a chaplain. As Chaplain your duty is simple, serve your god, or
    gods, in a manner that benefits the crew (up for interpretation). Most rounds
    you\u2019ll end up holding funerals for those that the station cares deeply about
    (and cremating everyone else). You come equipped with your holy text, endowed
    with the unique ability to BibleThump. With your deep spirituality, you are also
    privileged when it comes to prayers; the deities you pray to are far more likely
    to hear, and answer, your prayers. \r\n\r\nYour responsibilities, like your station
    access, are limited. Invoking spirituality amongst the crew is your main priority
    - so not much besides begging people to attend services and nobody showing up.
    Being a roleplay heavy role, it\u2019s encouraged that you interact with the crew
    to create events or to enforce religious sanctions and rulesets. Religion is sparse
    in this corner of space, so don\u2019t expect everyone to get in line outside
    your office unprompted.\r\n\r\nNot sure what to do? Declare the day a religious
    holiday and host festive events, decide the station heathen to follower ratio
    is far too low and go on missionary trips to all the departments, host seminars
    to educate the masses, or give the clown your holy blessing! You\u2019re not limited
    to real religions, so feel free to make your own! Be creative and create some
    new and exciting (or extreme) rules! Try to convert people to your religion and
    unite, or divide, the station.\r"
