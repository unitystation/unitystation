  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Make food\n\u2022 Keep the crew fed\n\u2022 Acquire meat"
  descriptionLong: "\rYou cook food and serve it to hungry stationeers. It is a calm
    and relaxing job, until everyone\u2019s hungry at the same time or the meat is
    running low. You are part of Station Service, the small gears in the background
    that keep the big gear running properly.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re expected to know
    how to chop meat, cook it, serve it, and make sure there\u2019s food available
    at all times. Obey the orders from the Head of Personnel and uphold the service
    to keep the station running properly. It only takes one hungry man to turn a
    peaceful station into anarchy, keep barbarism at bay!\r\n\r\nNot sure what to
    do? Experiment with new and exotic meat, make a burger that transcends everyone
    into ghosts. Do not serve the crewmembers meat from a dubious origin.\r"
