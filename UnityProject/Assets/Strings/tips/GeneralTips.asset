  - Body parts can be dismembered and burnt using the right weapons and tools.
  - Your lungs can bleed from the inside, forcing you to drown in your own blood.
  - Security officers can heal a small amount of brute damage by eating donuts.
  - Lizards have thicker skins that allow them to have more chances against attacks
    that might otherwise be deadily for other races.
  - Play as a janitor as your first time. You have a clear goal and no one expects

  - A Proto-Kinetic Accelerator (PKA) can destroy walls.
  - Kick back and relax at the bar or dorms and play
    some card games or Dungeons & Dragons with your other crewmates.
  - Killing your crewmates for no reason is the fastest way upset a mob -- and server
    admins.
  - As the quartermaster, it is your job to make sure that all departments are well
    supplied. However, never be afraid of denying some requests. Seriously, does
    the clown really need ten costume crates?
  - Plants need water, nutrients and care. Keep an eye on them and make sure they
    grow up healthy.
  - You can use a crowbar to open airlocks and unpowered doors.

  - Snacks from vending machines aren't fulfilling, but they're good enough to keep
    you running for a few more minutes.
  - Say <i>"Come Ian!"</i> near Ian the dog to make him come to you.
  - A handcuffed or restrained player cannot move freely if you grab or pull them.
  - If you die, there's always a chance you can respawn as another character or play
    as a ghost role.
  - Touching a light bulb without gloves will cause burn damage to your hand.
  - Letters, manifests and documents can be printed from a printer.
  - Clowns who take off their outfit as a sort of meta-disguise are the most dishonorable
    of all traitors, but there's no denying the practice can work wonders and catch
    even veterans off-guard.
  - There are plenty of ways to gib your victims on the station, however many are
    job specific.
  - Eventually the gravitational singularity will emit electromagnetic pulses, which will fry nearby devices,
    including cameras and headsets.
  - Your role as a detective is only loosely related to law enforcement. You're better
    suited for information gathering rather than arrests.
  - Flashlights emit light even when in your pocket.
