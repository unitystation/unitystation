To use this Update manager all you need to do is let your class inherit from OverridableMonoBehaviour

if you use the Awake function you'll have to change it into protected override void Awake()
Also call the OverridableMonoBehaviour.Awake() function on the first line of your Awake function.

You'll have to replace your Update method to public override void UpdateMe()
Once you've done that you'll be able to use this package.

If you're using the FixedUpdate and or the LateUpdate, you can use the FixedUpdateMe() method and or the LateUpdateMe() method.

To remove objects from your UpdateManager, all you need to do is all the methods UpdateManager.RemoveSpecificItem or UpdateManager.RemoveSpecificItemAndDestroyIt
These method names should speak for themselves.

If somehow your object does not get added to the Update manage you can still add it by using the UpdateManager.AddItem method

Please keep in mind to not destroy more than 2.000 objects at the same time, this will unfortunately decrease the performance for a few frames.
Adding up to 10.000 objects on your Awake function is possible, but will take some time before your game will actually start.
