<b>What's Happening?</b>
I have decided to push VLS2D to GitHub due to a personal schedule issues and not being able to commit 100% of my time to improving the product. I expect to return to the open source project very soon but for now I look forward to seeing what type of improvements this wonderful community makes!

<b>Note</b>
<i>Please keep in mind that this version is currently buggy as it is an alpha project. If you discover a bug or what you might think is a bug and do not see it on the list please add it to the bugs list. If you feel you can solve the bug, by all means please give it a shot! Otherwise, I or someone else will get to it as soon as we can.</i>

Happy Coding! - Jake Fletcher - www.picogames.com
