  ########## HOW TO UPDATE UNITY_LICENSE ##########
  # The job below is only used to request a new activation file
  #
  # !!! WARNING: Use a throw away Unity account for this since anyone will have access to the license file !!!
  #
  # If you need a new one follow these steps:
  #   - Uncomment the job below and run it
  #   - Download the manual activation file that appears as an artifact in a zip (Unity_v20XX.x.alf).
  #   - Visit license.unity3d.com, sign in and upload it.
  #   - You should now receive your license file (Unity_v20XX.x.ulf) as a download.
  #   - Replace UnityLicense.ulf in the Tools directory with it.
  #   - Make sure LICENSE_FILE_PATH in the 'Setup license' step still points to it.
