## Purpose:

The Centcomm missions provide the basic global objectives for the station crew to work towards. 
These goals will include exploring the solar system and mining plasma deposits.
The crew will also receive a commendation (AKA green text) for each objective they complete by round end.

## Communication to the crew:

At the start of each round a piece of paper will spawn on top of each command console. A station wide announcement will be broadcast to inform the staff that the objectives have been received.

## CENTCOMM Mission Statement sheet:

On the sheet these points of information will be found:

* A list of suspected (last seen) asteroid locations
* CENTCOMM official order request for plasma (how much the crew needs to send back to centcomm via cargo)
