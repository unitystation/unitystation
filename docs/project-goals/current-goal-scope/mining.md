## Outline:

The very basics of the mining job role will need to be developed. Some simple items will need to be made (a pick-axe tool and portable lamp).

## Mission:

The miners will need to use the coordinates from the Centcomm mission statement to go out and search for nearby asteriods. The miners will need to wear hardsuits and oxygen tanks with sufficient oxygen to explore asteroid sites once they have found them. Once they find an asteroid they will need to park the shuttle nearby and use their pick-axes to mine through rock in search of solid plasma.

## Plasma

Plasma is used to power shuttles, generate power on the station and fulfill the Centcomm order requirements.

## Random Events:
While mining and searching for asteroids, miners will have a small chance of encountering hostile aliens.
