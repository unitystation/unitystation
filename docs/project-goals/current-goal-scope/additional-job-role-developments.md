# Additional Job Role Developments
## Overview:

Some additional roles will need to be developed to a basic enough standard to support the operation of the station:

**Goals:**
* The Janitor will be able to clean up blood with the mop and pick up trash with the trash bags
* Medical staff will be required to clone the dead (as respawn will be disabled) and heal the injured with the bruise packs and burn ointment
* Head of Personnel will have a job adjusting roles and giving additional access to balance the operational state of the Station
* Security guards will need to be able to stun and cuff people to detain antags
