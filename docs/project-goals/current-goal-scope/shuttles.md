## Additional Shuttle work:

Shuttles will need to be powered by plasma tanks secured to a pipe that connects to the shuttle thrusters. Once a canister is secured a plasma amount readout will be available on the shuttle GUI.

There will be full tanks of gas plasma in atmospherics but new gas plasma can be made by grinding down solid plasma.

## Plasma Stocks:

At the start of the round all shuttles will already have a full canister attached to their thrusters. A small stack of solid plasma will be available in cargo for the distribution in the early stages of the game while miners go out and find more deposits.

Solid plasma is also used in the engineering power generators. The SMES on arrival will have enough power for about 40 minutes of station use. If there are no active power generators secured to the power network by then, then the crew will experience blackouts.
