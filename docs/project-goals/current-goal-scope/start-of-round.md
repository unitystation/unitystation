## Overview:

At the start of the round the asteriods that are mapped to a matrix move component will be placed at random coordinates and these coordinates will be used to mix in with false ones that will appear on the CENTCOMM mission statements.

The power network on the station will be placed in standby mode and low level visibility will be provided by the red emergency lights placed in the halls. No APC's will be on when the crew arrives.

## Crew's first goal:

One of the crew members will need to be an engineer or have access (or get access from the HoP) to set the SMES's to online mode.
