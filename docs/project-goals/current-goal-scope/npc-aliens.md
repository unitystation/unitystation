## Overview:

 Hostile Alien encounters will be comprised of a group of basic NPC entities that have a small chance of being spawned near crew members who are exploring the solar system for asteroids. They can only be spawned near shuttles that have stopped completely in space or near players on asteroids. They will have a basic matrix based path finding system and will possess the ability to perform melee + projectile attack actions. They can also break through windows of shuttles and open doors. 

Once an alien encounter has happened the chance of another one happening in the same area rises significantly. This will all be controlled via GameManager on the server.
