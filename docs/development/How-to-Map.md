# How to Map

This page explains the details of how to do mapping within unitystation.

All mapping is done in Unity.

### Setting Up Your Workspace
You should have the following windows open. To open a window, go to the _Window_ tab at the top of Unity.
* Window > General > __Scene__
* Window > General > __Project__
* Window > General > __Hierarchy__
* Window > General > __Inspector__
* Window > 2D > __Tile Palette__

### Introduction to Scenes
Unity uses [scenes](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CreatingScenes.html) to define environments and menus. Let's look at one.
* Open an existing scene: Project > Assets > Scenes > OutpostStation
* Make sure you have your Scene window focused
* Look around the Scene with the [Hand Tool](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SceneViewNavigation.html)

Notice that in the Hierarchy window selecting _OutpostStation_ selects the entire station, but not other shuttles, etc.
You can save maps and areas as [prefabs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html) by dragging them from the Hierarchy tab into the Project tab.

### Tile Palette
* The Tile Palette tab lets you place walls, floors, doors, tables etc. into the Scene tab
* Make sure to select the right Active Tilemap in the Tile Palette when editing
* The new tiles and objects will be added to the right categories within the active tilemap automatically

### Edit a Palette
Tiles are added to the palettes as they are created. To create a new Tile follow this example:
- Choose a tile from /Tilemaps/Tiles/Objects
- Drag a tile to a palette

### Create a new map
* TODO: How do you create a new map from a station palette?
* TODO: How do you add your new map for map selection, other than this: [Testing custom maps in Multiplayer](../contribution-guides/Building-And-Testing.md)?

## Mapping Guidelines
Objects should never be rotated using the Transform. Their local rotation should always be 0, 0, 0. If you change it, it will either not have any effect or may have unexpected consequences. If there is any need to rotate an object, define its facing, etc...it should be done via Directional or other components.

Various objects which already have directional facing logic, such as wallmounts and chairs, can have their direction set by adjusting Directional's Initial Direction field.

### Wallmounts
Wallmounts always appear upright, but you need to indicate which side of the wall they are on (they should only be visible from one side of a wall). To do this, simply set the Directional component's Initial Direction to the direction it should be facing.

Enabling Gizmos for WallmountBehaviours will show helper arrows so that you wouldn't need to guess their direction:

## Pull Requests for Tile Palette Changes
Almost never would you need to actually PR a palette change, if you do please make sure __NOT__ to include anything other than the palette file and its .meta file.
