# Component Development Checklist
Summarizes the things to remember when creating a new component or trying to fix a broken one:

1. Does the component properly handle the object lifecycle? See [Proper Spawning and Despawning (Object Lifecycle)](Proper-Spawning-and-Despawning-(Object-Lifecycle).md)
1. Does your component function correctly even when its object is in inventory? See [Inventory System](Inventory-System.md).
1. If using SyncVars, [are they being used properly?](SyncVar-Best-Practices-for-Easy-Networking.md)
