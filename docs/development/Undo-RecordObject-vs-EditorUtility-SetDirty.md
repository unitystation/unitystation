When you need to save changes generated by scripts in the editor

# Which one should you use Undo-RecordObject or EditorUtility.SetDirty 


You should use both because apparently
Undo-RecordObject = For objects in scenes
EditorUtility.SetDirty = Objects in prefab edit mode,

Majority of the time You don't know which one you're in if you do, If you do know which one it is in its best to do both Still because unity is weird, Better safe than sorry
