# Server Utilities.
This directory contains the installation helper scripts and template files for setting up a Unitystation server.  
File names should be self explanitory, however:  
`installserver.sh` > Prepare a system and install the Unitystation server and service.  
`update.sh` > Update an existing installation  
`editconfig.sh` > Edit configuration paramters  
`config.example.json` > Example & template configuration file (Used by installserver.sh, please don't change the template values!)  
`unitystation.service` > Systemd unit file for the server.  
 All these files can be found hosted on the cdn, https://unitystationfile.b-cdn.net/ but are not updated automatically.
